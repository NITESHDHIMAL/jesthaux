    <h2 class="heading">Understanding the Impact: Gaza's IT Infrastructure After Iran's Attack on Israel</h2>

    <p>
        The Israeli technology region, being a stronghold, a beacon of creativity, has helped in the development of the
        country's economic landscape. Itâ€™s a remarkable contribution, providing for 18.1% of the country's GDP in 2022,
        and a mind-boggling 48.3% of its exports, showing how crucial the oil sector is to the international market.

        Nevertheless, the war of the present time looms larger than the industry which has been thriving, bringing in a
        huge number of problems and interruptions. The incredible fact of the war is the 15-20% of tech employees being
        drafted into the Israeli Defense Forces and especially the most talented ones who occupy the leadership
        positions in startups. This abrupt exit of highly skillful employees has brought about a lot of inconveniences
        to many companies in their day-to-day operations. This has also led to a shortage of expertise in the
        organizations.

        Ensuring the continuity and stability of the Israeli tech community, agencies have shown patience and sincerity
        through the implementation of a range of measures to assist their employees in difficult situations. These
        initial steps may comprise of making work-from-home options available and to this end people can continue with
        their military duties while still retaining their professional obligations. Furthermore, lodges with care leave
        and part-time employment offers were provided to ease the burden on workers who face problems related to
        military services.</p>
